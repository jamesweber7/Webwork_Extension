# Webwork_Extension

We use this site for my math homework, but I did not like some of the default input behavior. This chrome extension improves the workflow.

Here is a [video explaining how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM0b95lquso)

Here are the shortcuts:
| Keys              |   Behavior            |
| :---------------- | :-------------------- |
| Shift + N         | Next Problem      |
| Shift + B         | Previous Problem  |
| Enter             | Submit Answers (Next problem if answers have already been submitted, and are all correct) |

The other benefit is two buttons to help you study:

1. A button labeled "Random Problem Button" that appears between the "Problem List" button and "Next Problem" button, while working on a set. This button will take you to a random problem within the set.
2. A button labeled "Study Problem" that appears in the drop-down of the plugin up in bookmarks bar.

## Set-up

Just watch from 2:18 to 4:10 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM0b95lquso&t=138), and follow along.

## About the code

I chose not to use JQuery for absolutely no good reason. Originally I wanted it to be very light, but I should have just used JQuery.
